## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- **The first point that resonated with me was the suggestion of setting S.M.A.R.T goals. OKR's (or objective and key results) was a concept that was first introduced to me in my first job at a startup. Similar to S.M.A.R.T goals, the purpose of OKR's is to clearly articulate what your goal(s) is, how you plan to achieve that goal(s), how to measure your efforts, and making sure those goals can be achieved within a specific time frame. This was always super useful to me, and I plan to use this method to set goals during my time at Turing.**
- **Seeking out challenges really resonated with me as well. One of my favorite quotes is "Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men". The purpose of seeking out challenge is to encourage growth. We cannot grow if we are comfortable, so intentionally seeking out challenge and making it a habit will allow for constant growth over time**

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- **I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by constantly asking questions, welcoming and taking on new challenges, and not getting bummed out when I fail. I could probably get better at understanding my Zone of Proximal Development by being a bit more patient with myself and not pushing myself so hard to learn new things quickly. It's a habit that is actually counterintuitive to a Growth Mindset and has lead to burnout in the past.**


3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

- **Conditional statements are used to compare values and perform a function or print a string if the statement is true.**
- **Example 1: if statements**
- **Example 2: elsif statements**
- **Example 3: else statements**

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

- **You might want to use an if statement if you want to print out a string or some other data type if certain conditions are met when comparing two or more variables.**

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```ruby
if variable1 > variable2
  puts "..."
```

    OR

```ruby
if variable1 == 1
  puts "..."
```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

-  **By adding a ";" after each condition.**


7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```ruby
if number_of_dollars >= price_of_car
  puts "I can afford the car."
elsif number_of_dollars < price_of_car
  puts "I can't afford the car."
else
  puts "I can't decide."
